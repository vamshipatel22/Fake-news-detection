# Fake-news-detection
# Problem Statement
Fake news has become one of the biggest challenges in the digital era, spreading misinformation across social media, blogs, and news platforms. This project aims to automatically detect whether a news article is Real or Fake using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
# Objectives
To develop an automated system that classifies news articles as Fake or Real using machine learning and NLP techniques.
To analyze and preprocess textual data by applying tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization, and vectorization.
To extract meaningful features from news content using methods like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
To train and evaluate multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest) and identify the best-performing algorithm.
To reduce the spread of misinformation by providing a reliable fake news detection tool.
To build a scalable and reusable pipeline that can be integrated into applications, dashboards, or API services.
To create a user-friendly prediction interface so users can input custom news text for real-time predictions.
To achieve high accuracy, precision, and recall, ensuring reliable classification on benchmark datasets.
